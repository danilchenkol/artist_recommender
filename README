This project implements a Python-based music artist recommender.
The recommender uses training data from multiple datasets (Last.fm, Deezer, etc.) to create artist profiles including the following info:
 - Last.fm tags;
 - ids of similar artists from Last.fm;
 - genres (from Deezer dataset);
 - fan countries (top-5 countries by Tweet number)
 - fan cities (same as above);
 - dominant fan gender;
 - dominant fan age;
 - ids of fans that marked an artist as favourite.
The above information is used to compute similarity between all artists (~3k) in the dataset and recommend top-10 artists given an input artist.

Usage:
 - run binary/recommender.exe;
 - enter artist name (the name must be present in the dataset; check bin\outputData\artist_info.csv for the list of available artists).
